The various objectives concerned with a control system i feel are as follows :

1)Maintaining the proper orientation of the car throughout the motion. For example: Parking control can be classified under this.
2)Following the desired path or trajectory smoothly to reach its destination.

Ways to solve these problems :

The controller may have a motor subsystem to monitor and control the throtle,braking and steering torque.
This includes the dynamics of each individual tyre.
Positioning subsystem may consist of cameras,GPS and distance sensors.This helps to pin point the cars's location with respect to its surroundings.
The cameras and sensors help to give a list of objects detected around the vehicle and create a 3-D world simulation.
The camera can also have an image processing unit. 
This unit uses certain algorithms.They can be used for lane marking,detection of road ends,objects(like nearby vehicle)detection,traffic light detections.
A central subsystem can act as the brain of control system.This records all the datta from both motor and positioning systems and analyze it.
It predicts the best suitable action and gives commands.
